// Pseudo-code for this app

// 1) save the values/DOM elements we will need to interact with
// let's query the dom for the form element and save it within a variable
// let's query the dom for the input element and save it with a variable

// 2) Attach a submit event listener to the form element
// pass in 2 arguements to the event listener method: the event you are listening for and the callback function which will hold the logic we wish to run once the event occurs on the page

// save the text value from the ouput into a variable

// IF the user submits a to do (check where the value is NOT empty) then:
    // create an li
        // add a font awesome icon to it
        // add the text from the to do the user entered to the li

    // append the li to the ul element
// ELSE alert the user to please submit a valid to do

// 3) do we track when the task is done?
